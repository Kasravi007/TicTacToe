# TicTacToe

This is a command-line based **Tic Tac Toe** game built in **C#**.  
It allows **two players** to register with their names and choose their own custom symbol (like `X`, `O`, `@`, etc.). The game is played on a **3x3 board**, and each move is tracked by typing the **box address**.

## üéÆ How the Game Works

1. When the application starts, it asks for:
   - **Player 1 Name**
   - **Player 1 Symbol**
   - **Player 2 Name**
   - **Player 2 Symbol**
   - *(Symbols must be unique and non-empty)*

2. The game then displays a 3x3 board with numbered positions 00","01","02","10","11","12","20","21","22" like below:


3. Players take turns entering the **box address (1-9)** where they want to place their symbol.

4. After each move, the board updates, and the system automatically checks:
- All **rows**
- All **columns**
- Both **diagonals**

to determine if a player has won.

5. If one of the players manages to align 3 of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, that player is declared the **winner**.

6. If all 9 boxes are filled and there's no winner, the game ends in a **draw**.

## üß† Game Rules

- Players cannot choose a box that is already filled.
- Symbols must be **different** for both players.
- Input validation is done to ensure players don't enter invalid box addresses or duplicate symbols.
